## Background

- The COVID-19 pandemic has caused suffering worldwide, with over 230 million cases and almost 5 million deaths


- It is widely accepted that this pandemic has caused an increase in mental illness, however there is not much data on how specific restriction affected mental health


- In this project, we explore the relationship between specific COVID-19 restrictions and mental illnesses


---

## Data

We used two data sets for this project

- First, we pulled data from Google Trends on the relative frequency of searches for mental health topics. We focused on OCD, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and therapy, from the start of 2019 through September 2021.

- Second, we used a data set that provided indexes derived from WHO data about restrictions in different countries. We focused on restrictions on schools, gatherings, businesses, travel, and masking.

- We merged these data sets by country and date $^*$

- Frequencies of search results were indexed and re-scaled so that 100 would be equivalent to the average of that result over the course of 2019.

## Analysis

- 5 Countries: Brazil, India, Mexico, The United States, & New Zealand

- Multiple Regression

## Evaluating Anxiety in the US

```{r usa-reg, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
US_data <- lim_set %>%
  filter(COUNTRY == "United States")

US_relative_anxiety_reg <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(relative_anxiety ~ MASKS + TRAVEL + GATHERINGS + SCHOOLS + BUSINESSES + MOVEMENTS, data = US_data)

US_relative_anxiety_reg %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>%   
  knitr::kable(digits=4,caption="Nation: USA, Search: Anxiety")
```

## Looking at all the Models

Out of all 25 models (only 20 had data for masking)...

- masking and school restrictions showed significant estimates for over half of the models

- 12 significant mask restriction estimates: 11 positive

- 13 significant school restriction estimates: 9 negative

## how to

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

---

## Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

---

## Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
penguins_modified <- penguins %>%
  mutate(species = fct_other(species, keep = "Adelie"))
```

```{r plot-penguins, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Body mass vs. flipper lenght of Palmer Penguins for species Adelie and all the others combined together. There is a relatively strong, positive relationship between the two variables. The Adelie penguins are clustered together but they don't exhibit a different trend than the rest of the penguins."}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified penguins dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(penguins_modified, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Some text
- goes here
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r penguins-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(penguins), format = "html")
```

---

## Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate."}
include_graphics("img/watercolour_sys02_img32_percolate.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

background-image: url(img/watercolour_sys02_img32_percolate.jpg)

## Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

## Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect the majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
